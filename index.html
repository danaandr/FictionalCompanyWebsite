      </div>
    <p> Born on 2 October 1974 Bjarke Ingels is a Danish architect who heads the architectural team. Known for his innovative and ambitious design approach, many of his buildings defy traditional architectural stereotypes. He incorporates sustainable development ideas into his designs, but often tries to achieve a balance between the playful and practical approaches to architecture. At the bedrock of Bjarke’s philosophy is his belief that in order to deal with today’s challenges, architecture can profitably move into a field that has been largely unexplored. </p>

          </div>
    <p>Both an architect and urban planner, he is implicated in the research of form and meaning. His work focuses on research over speculation and concerns the quality of life; aesthetics are conditioned by ethics; and he maintains that we have too often dissociated one from the other. He thus focuses on all scales of construction, from simple buildings to urban re-think; with the town as a founding principal of his work, developing a parallel and a crossover along three major lines: neighbourhood or city pieces, individual buildings and sky-scrapers.</p>

   <p>Internationally recognized for her innovative use of materials and environmentally sensitive approach, Jeanne explores the role of design in revitalizing cities. Through projects involving community anchors and cultural institutions to tall mixed-use buildings and urban planning, she engages pressing contemporary issues and their impact on the human experience. A distinguished graduate of the Harvard Graduate School of Design, she has taught at Harvard, Yale and Princeton where her studios have focused on cities, ecologies, and materials.</p>
